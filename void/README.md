# Void Linux Setup Instructions
A list of instructions for installing TrueCommand on Void Linux.

**Note** : Ensure you have the "wget" utility installed first: `xbps-install -y wget`

Run this command (as root) from a system terminal

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iXsystems/truecommand-install/main/void/setup.sh -O - | bash
```

You can see the details of the "quick setup" script here: [setup.sh](setup.sh).
